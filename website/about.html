The hawksbill sea turtle is a sea turtle belonging to the Cheloniidae family. Cheloniidae is a family of typically large turtles that are characterized by shared traits such as flat rounded shells and limbs modified into flippers for better swimming. Similar to other marine animals, the hawksbill sea turtle possesses a flattened body shape, a protective carapace, and limbs like flippers similar to others in the Cheloniidae family. The hawksbill sea turtle has an easily distinguishable unique beak-like mouth, which resembles that of a hawk, thus where its name originated from.

                <h4> Location:</h4>
            <p> 

                Hawksbill sea turtles reside in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. The largest populations of hawksbills are located in the Caribbean, Indian, and Indo-Pacific Oceans. The hawksbill turtles are known as travelers and thus travel great distances from their feeding sites to nesting grounds. The nesting grounds of hawksbill turtles are found on remote beaches, with the largest being found in Australia and Solomon Islands.

                <h4> Diet:</h4>
            <p>


Although hawksbill turtles are omnivorous, their preferred food is sea sponges. They are the sole species of sea turtle that can survive on a diet consisting mainly of sponges. By using their narrow pointed beaks, the hawksbill turtle can extract the sponges from crevices on the reef. Other foods that the hawksbill turtle consume include marine algae, corals, mollusks, crustaceans, sea urchins, small fish, and jellyfish.
